## Blueberry Chocolate Chip Cookies

### Ingredients:
- **2 ¼ cups (280g) all-purpose flour**
- **1 tsp baking soda**
- **½ tsp salt**
- **1 cup (230g) unsalted butter**, softened to room temperature
- **¾ cup (150g) granulated sugar**
- **¾ cup (150g) packed brown sugar** (light or dark)
- **1 tsp vanilla extract**
- **2 large eggs**
- **1 ½ cups (255g) semisweet chocolate chips** (slightly reduce from original)
- **1 cup (150g) fresh blueberries** (washed and dried thoroughly)
- **1 cup (125g) chopped nuts** (optional, like walnuts or pecans)

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the oven** to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.

2. **Mix dry ingredients:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

3. **Cream butter and sugars:** In a large bowl, using a hand mixer or stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together on medium speed until smooth and creamy (about 2-3 minutes).

4. **Add eggs and vanilla:** Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and add the vanilla extract. Mix until fully incorporated.

5. **Combine wet and dry ingredients:** Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Do not overmix.

6. **Add chocolate chips and blueberries:** Gently fold in the chocolate chips and the fresh blueberries using a spatula. Be careful when mixing the blueberries, as they are delicate and can burst. If using nuts, fold them in as well.

7. **Shape the dough:** Scoop 1 to 2 tablespoons of dough per cookie, rolling it into a ball, and place it onto the prepared baking sheet. Be sure to leave about 2 inches between each ball of dough.

8. **Bake:** Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers should remain soft, but the cookies will firm up as they cool.

9. **Cool the cookies:** Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

### Tips for success:
- **Fresh Blueberries**: Make sure the blueberries are dry before adding them to the dough, as excess moisture can affect the texture of the cookies.
- **Frozen Blueberries**: If you use frozen blueberries, don't thaw them beforehand; otherwise, they may release too much liquid.
- **Balance flavors**: The combination of sweet chocolate chips with slightly tart blueberries creates a nice flavor contrast.
